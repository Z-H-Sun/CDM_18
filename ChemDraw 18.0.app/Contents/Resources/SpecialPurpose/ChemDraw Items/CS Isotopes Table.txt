# ChemDraw Isotopes Table
#
# Format of this file:
#	Lines beginning with '#' are comments.  Blank lines are ignored.
#	Values must be seperated by commas, spaces or tabs.
#	If you edit this file, you must save it as a text file, not a wordprocessor or spreadsheet format.
#
#	The data consists of element lines and isotope lines.
#	Each element line may be followed by one or more isotope lines.
#	If no isotope lines are present, the element is assumed to exist in
#		a single isotope with 100% abundance, with mass equal to the
#		average mass for the element.
#
#	An element line consists of the following fields (later-occurring fields may be omitted):
#		Element Name (three characters or less)
#		Atomic Number
#		Average Mass (at natural abundance)
#		Parenthesized list of permitted valences (optional)
#		Full name
#		1st Ionization potential (kJ/mol)
#		Electronegativity (Pauling)
#		Melting point (celsius)
#		Boiling point (celsius)
#		Density (g/ml)
#		Atomic radius (Angstroms)
#		Group
#		Period
#		Discoverer
#	An isotope line consists of the following fields:
#		Exact mass
#		Abundance (assumed zero if omitted)
#		Nickname (optional)
#
# Users are strongly cautioned against making changes to the element symbol, atomic number, 
# and permitted valence lists, as changes to those fields will have particularly wide-reaching 
# effects across CambridgeSoft applications.
